1) Influencify is a web platform that will serve to help up and coming content creators develop professionally by allowing them to be under the guidance of highly experienced streamers. The platform will feature a way to friend other users, direct messaging, and forming group chats. It will also provide professional content creators the option to do live video classes for prospective streamers. 

2) The motivation came from one of my coworkers, who streams video games. When he started this career path, he had to learn by himself how to effectively gain and retain followers as well as how to generate entertaining content. Hearing about this from him made me realize that there needs to be a platform solely for the people that want to join the streaming industry. There needs to be a space that neglects the barrier to entry and allows the said people to follow their passion. This is what Influencify’s main goal is. It’s to distribute the knowledge required to become a professional streamer in an efficient manner via mentorships.

3) The target audience for this application are people who want to learn how to stream. 

4) There are competitors like Skillshare, Udemy, and other such learning platforms. However, there is a key difference between these platforms and ours in that Influencify is specifically targeted towards people who are interested in learning how to create content. By having a focal group, we hope to generate a one stop platform that helps individuals become professional streamers.
